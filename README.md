# UIUC Degree Planner

UIUC Degree Planner is an application for keeping track and planning undergraduate degrees for UIUC students.

## Description

This application was designed to be a degree planner for UIUC students to not only plan all 4 years of their undergraduate degrees, but to provide other useful information as well, such as the degree requirements that are needed or have already been fulfilled, advanced course searching based on a variety of course attributes, and overall organization of degree information.

## Usage

Currently, the user can only create one student. Creating a student basically creates all details needed for the user to get started on planning their undergraduate degree. Unfortunately, the most recent version of this application only supports undergraduate Computer Engineering students, but eventually it will be updated to include both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. 

Make sure path is set to 'run'. QTCreator required.
